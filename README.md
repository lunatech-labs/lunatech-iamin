# Lunatech's I am in

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to solve the problem of overflooding team calendars with entries like "Working from home" or "Working from Amsterdam/Rotterdam office". Having people working from different locations is a common practice nowadays, one of the problems that comes with it is to know who works where on every particular day for planning/information purposes.

This project is meant for tracking this information.

## Backend

Please look at the [dedicated README](https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-iamin/tree/master/backend) inside the backend folder.

## Frontend

## List of sections to have in the README
